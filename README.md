# Classical Simulation of Quantum Algorithms

## Prequisites :

Anconda Distribution for Python : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

This repository contains classical simulation of quantum algorithms:

1. Grover's Algorithm Simulation
2. Boyer's Exponential Search Simulation
3. Durr-Hoyer Modified Maximum Finding Algorithm

We can visulaize and simulate each and every step of these algorithms to get a better insight and understanding.
It can also be used for conducting experiments.
